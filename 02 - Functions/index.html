				<h2>02 - Functions</h2>
			</div>

			<p>
				JavaScript is a <em>functional</em> programming language, and functions play a vital role in it. For this set of exercise you will be given some functions and will be asked to implement others.
			</p>



			<h3>Defining a function</h3>
			<p>
				As we saw in the introduction, there are several way to define a function. Let's consider the "explicit" one:
				<pre>
function my_function(x, y) {
	var z = x * y + x - y;

	return z - 5;
}
				</pre>
				Definition of a function has the form: <em>function &lt;name&gt; ( &lt;argument list&lt; ) { &lt;body&gt; }</em>. Observe that spaces and newlines are not necessary, but are used to improve readability by programmers. The <em>name</em> can be any identifier, the <em>argument list</em> is a comma-separated list of arguments (for example: <em>arg1, arg2, arg3</em>) of any length (even 0), and the body is an arbitrary piece of JavaScript code.
			</p>

			<p>
				Variables declared in the argument list must not be declared again in the function body:
				<pre>
// This is wrong!
function foo(a, b) {
	var a = a;
	var b = b;

	return a + b;
}

// This is right.
function foo(a, b) {
	return a + b;
}
				</pre>
			</p>



			<h3>Examples</h3>
			<p>
				So, what can you do with functions? Here are some examples:
				<pre>
/**
 * Prints an error message on the console.
 * @param message Message to print
 */
function display_error(message) {
	console.log("[ERROR] " + message);
}


/**
 * Prints a warning message on the console.
 * @param message Message to print
 */
function display_warning(message) {
	console.log("[WARNING] " + message);
}


/**
 * Tells whether an array is empty (i.e. contains no element).
 * @param array Array to examine
 * @return true if array contains no element, false otherwise
 */
function is_empty_array(array) {
	var n = array.length;

	if (n == 0) {
		return true;
	}
	else {
		return false;
	}
}
				</pre>
				these function prints error and warning messages on the console.

				<pre>
/**
 * Tells whether an array is empty (i.e. contains no element).
 * This function is the same as the previous one, but uses a more compact syntax.
 * @param array Array to examine
 * @return true if array contains no element, false otherwise
 */
function is_empty_array2(array) {
	return array.length == 0;
}
				</pre>
				This function is an utility which tells whether an array is empty (i.e. contains no element).


				<pre>
/**
 * Composes two unary functions into a single one.
 * Recall the meaning of function composition: "(f o g)(x)" (f composed with g applied to x)
 * is equal to "f(g(x))" (f applied to the result of g applied to x).
 * @param f first function to compose
 * @param g second function to compose
 * @return A new function, composition of f and g
 */
function compose(f, g) {
	return function (n) {
		return f(g(n));
	}
}


/**
 * Returns successor of a number.
 * For instance, successor(0) returns 1, successor(41) returns 42.
 * @param n Number
 * @return Successor of n
 */
function successor(n) {
	return n + 1;
}
				</pre>
				<em>Successor</em> computes successor of a number. <em>Compose</em>, on the other hand, is a "strange" function: it takes two functions as arguments, and creates a new function which is the equivalent of the first applied to the result of the second. This may seem a bit abstract to the non-mathematical minded, but play an important role. For instance, suppose you want to create "+2", "+3", "+4" functions which add 2, 3 and 4 to their arguments (like the <em>successor</em>): one possibility is to define one new function for each, or you could use the <em>compose</em> abstraction in the following way:
				<pre>
var plus2 = compose(successor, successor);
				</pre>
				What is this? <em>plus2</em> is a variabile initialized with the result of <em>compose</em>. The latter is given two <em>successor</em> functions as arguments, hence it produces a new function which, when applied to a number <em>n</em>, is equivalent to <em>successor(successor(n))</em>, which is exactly <em>n + 2</em>. Therefore:
				<pre>
var plus3 = compose(plus2, successor);
var plus4 = compose(plus4, successor);
				</pre>
				Are a quick way to accomplish the task.
			</p>

			<div class="alert alert-info">
				Observe that last exemple was for didactic purposes: there are better ways to obtain a function which performs a "+N" task. The goal of this example was to show to create, pass and handle functions in JavaScript.
			</div>


			<h3>Exercise: define your functions</h3>
			<p>
				For this exercise, edit the file <em>02-01_functions.html</em> and follows directives from line 35. Don't forget you are given the solution file <em>02-01_functions_solution.html</em>.
