				<h2>03 - JSON</h2>
			</div>

			<p>
				<abbr title="JavaScript Object Notation">JSON</abbr> is a format used to store and transfer information. As the name suggests, it is "based" on JavaScript objects, although it is language-independent. JSON files can used to hold structured data, for instance a list of people, or details about an event. Feel free to read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON" target="_blank">Wikipedia entry for JSON</a> for some info and notes.
			</p>



			<h3>Example</h3>
			<p>
				From JavaScript's point of view, a JSON is nothing but an object (or array). This is an example of JSON showing details about an event:
				<pre>
{
	id: "alrncxh91jfo",
	name: "Spring Festival",
	date: "2017-03-21 21:00:00",
	place: "Town square"
	description: "Great celebration for this year's spring!",
	note: "Free entrace"
}
				</pre>
				As any JavaScript object, it contains pairs in the form <em>key: value</em>. Here is another example with a list of people:
				<pre>
[
	{
		name: "John",
		surname: "Smith",
		address: "5, Fake Street"
	},
	{
		name: "Pablo",
		surname: "Guerra",
		address: "7, Main Street"
	},
	{
		name: "Daisy",
		surname: "Duck",
		address: "6, Duckbourg"
	}
]
				</pre>
			</p>



			<h3>JSON files</h3>
			<p>
				A JavaScript object can be safely embedded in a JavaScript piece of code. It is also possible to have a separate JSON file, containing only the JSON object (no code!). Such a file has <em>.json</em> extension, for instance <em>data.json</em>.
			</p>



			<h3>Exercise: write your JSON</h3>
			<p>
				For this exercise, edit the file <em>03-01_json.html</em> and follows directives from line 84. In this exercise you are provided with function to display data in a HTML page (these functions use jQuery, but do not worry about them), and you are asked to write JSON data to display. Don't forget you are given the solution file <em>03-01_json_solution.html</em>.
