# Responsive Web Design - JavaScript Exercises
This is additional, optional material for students of the Responsive Web Design course. You are free to use and redistribute files and source code form this material for any use.

Material is organized as follows:

main folder contains subfolder named as "number - name", where numberare progressive numbers suggesting the order in which you should approac the exercises, while name is an explicative name of the content
each subfolder contains at least an index.html file, which explains the subject of the exercise, shows some examples and/or describes what to to in the exercises
each subfolder may contain "exercise files" named as number-exerciseNumber_name.html (for example: 99-58_some-exercise.html), where number is the same number identifying the subfolder, exercise are progressive number identifying exercises within a subfolder and name is mnemonic name for the exercise
every time an "exercise file" is provided, a proposal of "solution file" is also given, and it is named as the corresponding "exercise file" plus _solution appended to the name (example: 99-58_some-exercise_solution.html)
as a rule of thumb, always open the index.html file first, as it contains every info you need for a particular set of exercises.
Exercises are in the form of partially compiled HTML (and JavaScript) files which students can complete. The source code is richly commented in order to give precise instructions about what to do.

These exercises are not part of the course, hence they are not required to complete the course, and are not subjected to the peer review mechanism, they are completely optional. Nevertheless, students are encouraged to discuss about exercises in the course discussion forum.
