			Remember to open you developer console to see the result!

		<!-- JavaScript code -->
		<script>
			// This is where you can put your JavaScript code.

			// You have to use the console.log function to display the result of some arithmetic expressions.
			// First one is given to you for free as an example, other have the calculation set and you need to print the result.
			// Last, some tell you how to compute the result, you will have to write the code for the computation AND the print

			// First exercise is provided as example, it is the sum of a (5) and b (10):
			var a = 5;
			var b = 10;
			console.log(a + b);

			// Second exercise, area of a rectangle (base times height). You are asked to display the area in the console
			var base = 4;
			var height = 12;
			var rectangle_area = base * height;
			console.log(rectangle_area);

			// Third exercise, perimeter of a square (recall: 4 times side). You are asked to display the perimeter
			var side = 12;
			var perimeter = 4 * side;
			console.log(perimeter);

			// Fourth exercise: circumference. You are given the radius of a circle, and are asked to compute it circumference
			// AND display the result. Recall circumference is given by: 2 * radius * PI. You can approximate PI to 3.14.
			var radius = 2;
			console.log(2 * radius * 3.14);

			// Fifth exercise: area of a circse. You are given the radius of a circle, and are asked to compute AND show its area.
			// Recall that area of a circle is given by radius^2 * PI, where radius^2 is the same as "radius * radius" can be approximated to 3.14
			var r = 4;
			console.log(r * r * 3.14);
